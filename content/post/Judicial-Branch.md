The judicial branch interprets the laws made by the legislative branch. They also decide on citizens' innocence when it comes to crimes committed and settle disputes between groups of people. 

Civil cases are when there are disputes between parties and the court must decide on who is right. The two types of cases are tort and breach of contract. A tort is when one party (the plaintiff) sues the defendant for damages (usually money) and a breach of contract is when the defendant breaks a contract that they agreed on. To decide on the winner, the judge or jury must choose whose evidence is more convincing. They can also settle out of court with a mediator (person who compromises) or an arbitrator (person who chooses who is right) to save time and money. 

Criminal law is when someone breaks a crime, and their innocence must be decided. The two crime types are misdemeanors and felonies. A misdemeanor is a minor crime while a felony is a major crime 

In a misdemeanor case, the person is arrested and is taken to court where a judge announces their crime and gives them an attorney if they do not already have one. A jury may be held to decide if there is enough evidence to go forward with the case. The defendant can then make a plea bargain where they can plead guilty for a possibly shorter sentence. If they plead not guilty the case continues and they go to a jury trial, and when the trial is over, the jury or judge will make their verdict on whether the person is guilty or not. 

In a felony case, the defendant is arrested, and a police report is filed, they are then taken to a judge and are told their charges. There will then be a preliminary hearing where a grand jury looks at the evidence and decides if there is enough for them to be possibly guilty. If there is enough evidence, they are formally charged with the crime and can make a plea bargain. If the defendant pleads not guilty, a trial of 12 people is made up where they look at all the evidence and decide on their innocence. For a decision to be made, all 12 people must agree. If the defendant is unhappy with the decision, they can appeal it and take it to a higher court. 

Maryland has four levels to their courts. The MD District deals with original minor offenses, the MD circuit deals with appeals from the district and original serious crimes, the MD appellate court is for appeals from the circuit, and the MD Supreme is for appeals from the appellate court. You may be able to appeal a Maryland supreme court decision to the national court, but that is very unlikely. The U.S. has a district for original federal cases, U.S. appellate for appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court which has final say over all other courts.

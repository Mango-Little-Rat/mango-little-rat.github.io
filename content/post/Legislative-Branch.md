The legislative branch is the branch that makes and carries out laws. It is divided into two chambers which are the Senate and the House of Representatives. The senate has 100 members, two per state, and they represent the whole state. The leader of the senate is the Vice President, and the senate can confirm presidential appointments and ratify treaties. The house of representatives has 435 members spread out based on each state's size. Each member only represents their district, and the house of representatives' powers are to initiate revenue bills, impeach officials, and elect the president if the votes are at a tie. 

The way each state gets representatives is from a census every ten years, which counts the population of each state and their growth. Reapportionment is deciding how representatives are divided among the states based off the census. A state’s governor can redraw the district lines so that their party can gain more seats in the house of representatives, which is called gerrymandering. 

A bill becomes a law in this Process 

1. A bill is introduced to congress in either chamber 

2. The bill is sent to a committee who knows a lot about the bill’s topic. The bill can then pass through without changes, be modified, be replaced, or be ignored and die 

3. The bill is sent to the floor of the chamber it was introduced in to be voted on by a majority 

4. Committee and floor debate happens in the other chamber 

5. A conference committee may need to form if two different versions of the bill pass to choose one bill to be sent to president 

6. President can sign or reject bill. If the bill is rejected, then it can be sent to congress to vote again and if 2/3 of both chambers vote for it to pass, then the bill will pass

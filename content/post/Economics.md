Economics is how people use their scarce resources for their wants and needs and how goods and services are produced and distributed. 

We have three types of resources, natural, human, and capital. Natural resources are the ones found in nature, human resources are people doing work, and capital resources are goods made by us that can be used multiple times and allow us to make more resources with them. We have a limited amount of these resources, so we need an economic system to distribute them to people. Opportunity cost is what we are giving up for another thing. For example, if you wanted to buy a board game but you need a new phone case, the limited resource is your money, and the opportunity cost is the option that you do not pick. 

We have four main types of economic systems 

Traditional economies are based on old customs and traditions where people do not use technology, do not use money, make their own goods, and trade for other goods. 

Market economies are where people have the freedom to get any good or service in any way that they want. People can start their own businesses, set their own prices, and the government has no control over it. 

Command economies are where the government makes all economic decisions. They own and control all capital and equipment, they control prices, and they tell workers what to make and how much of it to make. 

Mixed economies are where the consumers and produces have lots of freedoms, but the government can get involved to protect the environment and citizens. The government may fix prices for some items, and they may ban some business practices and products for being dangerous to consumers and the environment. 

The business cycle is what shows business activity and is a sign of how the economy is doing. There are four stages of the cycle. A peak is the highest point, a recession is when activity is declining, a trough is the lowest point, and expansion is growth. Economic indicators also tell us how the economy is doing. One of these indicators is GDP, which is the total value of all goods and services produced within a year. The CPI is what measures changes in prices, Inflation is when the prices increase, and deflation is when they decrease. The Unemployment Rate is the percentage of people without a job.  

These are the economic indicators during the stages of growth and decline 

Expansion: GDP increases, Unemployment Rates are down, and inflation 

Recession: GDP decreases, high Unemployment Rates, and deflation  

The government needs to try and keep the business cycle stable by not having too much inflation or too much deflation because the economy will make the economy stop functioning. To combat these effects, the government has monetary and fiscal policies. Fiscal policy is controlled by congress and the president. They try to control our consumer spending by changing the tax rates and the government’s spending. Curing an expansion, they increase tax rates and decrease spending and during a recession, they increase spending and decrease tax rates. Monetary policy is controlled by the federal reserve. Their goal is to change the amount of money in the economy. The tools they have for this are reserve requirements, which is the amount of money that banks cannot loan out, the discount rate, which is the interest rates for getting a loan, and OMO, which is buying and selling bonds to consumers. During expansion, they increase the discount rate and reserve requirement, and they sell bonds. During a recession, they decrease the reserve requirement and discount rate, and they buy bonds. 

We have 11 agencies that regulate economic aspects, these include 

CDC: They try to reduce the spread of diseases 

CPSC: Monitors product safety  

DEA: They investigate drug traffickers 

EPA: They protect the environment 

FAA: Ensures aviation safety 

FBI: Investigates criminals 

FCC: Regulates communication methods like phone, radio, and TV 

FDA: Protects us from unhealthy foods 

FTC: Protects us from false advertising 

OSHA: Protects the workforce for unsafe conditions 

SEC: Regulates stocks and bonds 

We also have five entitlement programs to help the disabled, elderly, and poor. Social security gives the retired an income, unemployment compensation gives unemployed people money until they get a job, worker’s compensation gives money to people injured on the worksite, Medicare provides medical insurance to those over 65 years old, and Medicaid provides health insurance for people of low income.

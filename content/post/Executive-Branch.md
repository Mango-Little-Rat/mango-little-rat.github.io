The executive branch is the leaders of the country like the presidents and the governors.  

1. Caucus and primaries occur, which is where candidates are chosen to run for president. A caucus is when the party members meet to select a candidate. A primary is where citizens vote for a candidate with ballots. The two types of primaries are open and closed. Open is where anybody can vote for anyone regardless of political affiliation, and closed is where you can only vote for your party. 

2. A convention occurs where each party sets their goals and beliefs, and their official choices for candidates are announced on a party ticket which says presidential and vice-presidential candidates. 

3. Each candidate advertises their campaign to try and convince people to vote for them 

4. The general election begins where citizens cast their votes for president 

5. The electoral college officially chooses the president  

6. Inauguration ceremony where president gives speech and goes into office 

The electoral college is the group that gets final say on who wins the presidency. There are 538 members 435 representatives, 100 senators, 3 from DC. The amount given to states depends on the number of representatives they have plus 2 senators. To win the election, a candidate needs 270 electoral votes, so they try to win the states that have the highest number of people in the electoral college. 

The president two types of powers which are constitutional and informal. Constitutional powers are the ones stated in the constitution. 

Executive Powers: Faithfully executing laws, nominating officials, requesting opinions from officials, and filling vacancies during congressional regressions. 

Judicial Powers: Grant pardons for federal crimes and nominates judges. 

Legislative Powers: Recommend legislation, present information on the state of the country, veto legislation, set congress’ hours, and stop what congress is doing for three days. 

Foreign Policy: Act as commander of armed forces, make treaties, nominate ambassadors, receive ambassadors, and diplomatically recognizing other governments. 

Informal powers are powers that the president has but are not stated in the constitution. Executive orders are an example of one of these. They have the power of a law but are more temporary and can be nullified by congress or declared unconstitutional by the supreme court. Executive treaties work like normal treaties but only ½ of each congressional chamber is needed for it to pass. The president can also send troops to war without formally declaring it. 

The governor is like the president but they only control things at a state level. The governor has most of the president’s powers but at a state level and they cannot make any treaties.

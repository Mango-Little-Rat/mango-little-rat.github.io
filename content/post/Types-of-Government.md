The main three types of government are monarchy, democracy, and dictatorship. A dictatorship is where one or more individuals have all control over everything such as China and North Korea. A democracy is where the people have the power by electing leaders that fit their needs. A monarchy can be a form of either of the two, an absolute monarchy is where the king or queen has all control, and a constitutional monarchy is where the king or queen has limited powers and there are other branches where people make decisions.  

Governments have three purposes. One is maintaining social order, which is making sure to keep peace in the country and to have laws to limit what citizens are allowed to do. Two is to provide public services, which is providing services that make life easier, such as education, libraries, and hospitals. The third purpose is to provide national security, this is protecting the people from other nations attacking the country and citizens. An example of this would be the military. The last purpose is to make economic decisions, which is making decisions to improve the economy and deciding what and how to provide for citizens. Three examples include taxes, trades, and the national budget. 

To be more specific on the democratic government, there are seven principles of a democracy. These principles include popular sovereignty, rule of law, limited government, individual rights and freedoms, majority rules with minority rights protected, equality under the law, and federalism. Popular sovereignty is making sure that the people have government power, such as elections. Rule of law is needing to have a written constitution. Limited government is making sure that the government’s powers are separated so that one branch does not have all the power. Individual rights and freedoms are self-explanatory, it is making sure that citizens have certain rights and freedoms. Majority rules with minority rights are making sure that even if most people want something, it cannot take away the rights of those who do not agree with it. Equality under the law is making sure that everybody is treated equally; if you are of a certain gender, race, class, or religion, you have the same rights, and one cannot have more than the others. Finally, federalism has power divided between states and the federal government by giving the states the ability to make some laws.

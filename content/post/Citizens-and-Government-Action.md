United States citizens have duties and responsibilities, duties are required, and responsibilities are not. Our duties are to obey laws, pay taxes, serve in the military when requested, and go to jury when requested. Our responsibilities are to vote, be informed, take part in government, help your community, and respect other’s rights.  

Regions are an area with at least one common characteristic which differentiates it from the others. Mayland has five regions which are western Maryland, which is rural and has a lot of mining, capital, which has a wealthier population and is near DC, central which is densely populated and has a lot of business with the Chesapeake Bay, eastern, which has a lot of tourism and crab hunting, and there is southern, which is developing currently and is very agricultural. Urban sprawl is the spreading of urban development, this is helpful because it helps the economy, allows for more resources, and supports diversity. The downsides of urban sprawl are how much pollution it causes, the land it takes away, and it puts more demand on the government.  

The United States has five foreign policy goals including 

 National security: which protects our nation from invaders  

Free and open trade: which allows better economic growth by providing us with more resources without extra cost,  

World peace: which gives us a lower chance of war allowing the country to focus on citizens 

Democratic governments: which makes foreign nations easier to work with and gives their citizens more rights 

Concern for humanity: which is ensuring that everyone is treated with respect and has their basic needs met. 

The four tools we have to help us accomplish these goals are diplomacy, which is negotiating with foreign countries, foreign aid, which is assisting countries in crisis, sanctions, which is punishing countries using the military, economy, and culture, and we have military action, which is using military force

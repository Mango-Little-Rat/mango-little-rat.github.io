The Articles of Confederation were the first guiding document for the new country. However, this document had many problems such as congress being unable to collect taxes, which made them powerless and poor. Trade also could not be regulated, making it difficult since every state had different tariffs and laws. Laws could not be enforced, so everybody was breaking them. New laws needed 9/13 states for approval, so decisions were rarely made. Amendments needed every state’s approval, so they were never made. There was no executive branch, meaning there was no leader. Finally, there was no national court, so criminals were unpunished.  

They needed a new guiding document, and that document would be the Constitution. The constitution has seven articles.

Article 1: The Legislative Branch

Article 2: The Executive Branch

Article 3: The Judicial Branch

Article 4: The States

Article 5: How to Amend

Article 6: Debts, Supremacy, Oaths, and Religion Tests

Article 7: Ratification 

The first three explain how each branch functions in relation to each other, but Article four and later are more complicated. Article four is about how new states can join the country, and how states relate to each other and the federal government. Article five talked about how to amend the constitution (make changes.) An amendment can be proposed by a vote of 2/3 or more of each house of congress, or a constitutional convention (meeting) being requested by 2/3 of state legislators. For the amendment to go into effect, 3/4 of the states’ legislators must approve it, or if the convention was requested by ¾ of the states. Article six talks about how debts from the Articles of Confederation will need to be paid off, how federal laws overpower state laws, and how religion tests are not allowed. Finnally, article seven said that if 9/13 states voted for the constitution to go into effect, then it would.

Checks and balances are when each branch checks the other two to make sure they are following their laws. The executive branch checks the judicial by appointing a judge, and they check legislative by vetoing laws and adjourning congress. The legislative branch checks the judicial branch by making amendments, impeaching supreme court justices, and rejecting supreme court appointments. They check the executive branch by rejecting presidential appointments, rejecting treaties, overriding a veto, impeaching the president, and withholding their funding. The judicial branch checks the executive and legislative branch by declaring their actions and laws unconstitutional, respectively. 

The Bill of Rights explains the rights that the states and citizens have. It was put in place because not having one was a concern for the people who did not want to ratify the constitution. Amendment one explains people’s freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, and protest. Amendment two says that citizens can have firearms. Amendment three says that soldiers cannot live in someone’s home without their permission. Amendment four says that people’s homes cannot be searched without a warrant. Amendment five says that in a trial, you cannot go to jail without a grand jury deciding, you can’t be charged with the same crime twice, you have protection against self-incrimination, due process, and your property can’t be taken away to fund public services. Amendment six says that trials are short and public, you have the right to a lawyer, you can have witnesses in your favor, you can question a witness that is against you, trials must happen in the area where the crime was committed, and you must be told of your accusations. Amendment seven says there are protections in a civil case, and the trial will be by jury if the damages are more than $20. Amendment eight says that fines and bail should be a reasonable price and there shall be no cruel or unusual punishments. Amendment nine says that you have rights not listed. Amendment ten says that rights not listed are decided by the states.
